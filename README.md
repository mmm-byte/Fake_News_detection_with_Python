## Introduction
Fake news has become a prevalent issue in today's digital age. This project focuses on developing a fake news detection system that can help users distinguish between authentic and fabricated news articles. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to automatically analyze the content of news articles and predict their authenticity.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Fake and real news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle. It consists of a collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. The dataset is split into two CSV files: one for fake news and another for real news.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Install the dependencies using pip:
